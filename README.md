# StreamsXmltv

StreamsXmltv is a command line utility to generate a XMLTV file containing TV Guide information for the streaming channels MSGSN, MSGSN2, Fox Sports Racing, and Marquee Sports  Network Plus. More can be added by request.  
It has executables that will run under Windows x64, OSX x64, Linux x64 and Linux ARM.  
There is one optional parameter, which is the additional days to get data beyond the default one day, and it creates a xmltv file in the same directory that the executable is in. So it will need write permissions to the directory for operating systems that require it.

## Note
StreamsXmltv is CharityWare. If you like this program and find it of value, please consider making a donation to a local charity that benefits children such as Special Olympics.
