# MSGSNXmltv

MSGSNXmltv is a command line utility to generate a XMLTV file containing TV Guide information for the streaming channels MSGSN and MSGSN2. It has executables that will run under Windows x64, OSX x64, Linux x64 and Linux ARM.  
There are no parameters, and it creates a xmltv file in the same directory that the executable is in. So it will need write permissions to the directory for operating systems that require it.
